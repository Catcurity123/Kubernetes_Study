#### A. Why do we use it?
(+) There is a lot of repetition in these YAML files, for example, we need to repeat the name demo, the label selector app: demo, and the port 8888 several times.

==> It would be greate to be able to define variables called something like `container.name` and `container.port` and then use them whenever they are needed in the YAML files.

(+) One popular package manager for K8S is called `helm`, and it works just the way we have described in the previous section.

#### B. How to use Helm
(+) There are 3 most important `helm` term we need to know:
- A `chart` is a `heml` package, containing all the resource defiition necessary to run an application in K8S
- A `repository` is a place where `chars` can be collected and shared 
- A `release` is a particular instance of a chart running in a K8S custer.

(+) `helm install <name> <path>`
==> `helm install demo ./k8s/demo`
(+) `helm list`: To check what releases we have running.
